I saw this request and thought of a possible visualization comparing the quality of movie and how often the user saw movies.  

I used Open IMDb api (omdbapi.com) which has a _free_ API (thanks!).  It probably would've been faster to just download in excel and take down scores by hand...but this was a good excuse to brush off the rust in python.

I'm pretty pleased to see some trends:

- 2010 was a banner movie year.  Just a ton seen, ranging from the great to the terrible (at least according to Rotten Tomatoes)
- I'm guessing the user was in college (high school?) 2009-2012 given the frequency of movies.  That would coordinate with 2011 being a year abroad (typically the third year of college).
- That timing also would explain why early movies were cheaper (light green) and lower scored: kid's fare.
- Those intense middle years were also when the user was willing to pay for tickets.  Earlier and later the price drops to shallow green (so more matinees?)
- Only high quality stuff nowadays, not wasting money and a trip to the theater for a mediocre film.
- Ghost Rider was one of the worst films seen, and the most expensive.  Oof.
